You can get an idea about the creation of normal login and signup page
## Tool
I have used a Visual Studio Code simulation tool to execute and edit the documents.  
## Login page
I have just created a login page with common fields typically found on such pages. The page includes spaces for username, password, email, and a "Remember me" checkbox. Additionally, I've incorporated a signup page and a Forgot password page. Clicking on the relevant links will direct users to the respective web pages for further processes. These pages have been developed using HTML.

I have applied coloring, styles, and various decorations using CSS. This enhances the styling of your web page, allowing for a wide range of decorative and stylistic options.

I have included the source code for the login page in an HTML file named "login.html" and the corresponding CSS styles for the login page are contained in the "loginstyle.css" file.

## Signup page
I have also designed a registration page with all the essential fields typically found during the signup process. The page features spaces for a username, password, email address field to ensure accuracy. Furthermore, there's an option for users to agree to the terms and conditions by checking a box. 

In addition to HTML, I've utilized CSS to apply visually appealing colors, styles, and layout arrangements, enhancing the overall user experience. This combination of functionality and aesthetics creates a seamless and inviting signup process for new users.

I have include the source code for the signup page in an HTML file named "signup.html" ant the corresponding CSS styles for the signup page are contained in the "signupstyle.css".
