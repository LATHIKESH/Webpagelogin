You can get an idea about the creation of normal login and signup page
## Tool
I have use an Visual Studio Code Simultion tool to execute and edit the documents  
## Login page
I have just created a login page with common fields typically found on such pages. The page includes spaces for username, password, email, and a "Remember me" checkbox. Additionally, I've incorporated a signup page and a "Forgot password" page. Clicking on the relevant links will direct users to the respective web pages for further processes. These pages have been developed using HTML.

I have applied coloring, styles, and various decorations using CSS. This enhances the styling of your web page, allowing for a wide range of decorative and stylistic options.

I have included the source code for the login page in an HTML file named "login.html," and the corresponding CSS styles for the login page are contained in the "loginstyle.css" file.
